    "\n",
    "**For any set of portfolio documents, automatically generate keywords and summaries per document, and generate a set of the main topics found. Accordingly, generate a data-model for the portfolio** \n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first notebook to get started on. It provides basic code that can be applied directly to  any portfolio documents. Here this code is worked through with an example of understanding the implications of the regularatory environment on project delivery in the nuclear sector.This can be replaced as the user generates her own results. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, this one starts from documents as text files and internet pages. The second example shows how to generate text files from pdfs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional features can be sought in the other notebooks once results have been generated for your portfolio documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Features\n",
    "- Summarises each document\n",
    "- finds keywords for each document\n",
    "- creates a similarity-search: for any new paragraph, it finds the most similar documents from the library\n",
    "- (propose a data-model for the portfolio, based upon these findings) ***(Status: incomplete)***\n",

    "\n",
    "## Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses GENSIM library\n",
    "- Starts from Text file rather than PDF\n",
    "- also starts from Internet page\n",
    "- creates corpus at Document level rather than paragraph level\n",
    "- for Topic model, starts from Bag of Words model, as an interim step only\n",
    "- It uses TFIDF model only as an interim step to LSI only\n",
    "- for similarity-search, it uses cosine similarity, based upon LSI model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attributes you can find in the other notebooks\n",
    "- Using other libraries than Gensim\n",
    "- Starting from Text file\n",
    "- creates corpus at paragraph level\n",
    "- uses Bag of Words model to generate results directly for similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "# Easy adjustments that can be made, but have not been shown here or elsewhere\n",
    "- for Topic model, uses only Bag of Words model \n",
